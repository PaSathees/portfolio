# AI Project Portfolio

Welcome to my AI project portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of machine learning and deep learning projects I've worked on using PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and MLOps tools. Each project includes a brief description, links to the code, and a summary of the key technologies used.

## Projects

| Project | Description | Technologies | Code | Demo | Key Features |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---- | ---- | ------------ |
| [Neural Network with Numpy](NUMPY/NN-WITH-NUMPY/NN_with_Numpy.ipynb) | Building ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) from scratch and testing it on a standard dataset. | Python,Numpy | [GitHub Folder](NUMPY/NN-WITH-NUMPY) | [Demo Notebook](NUMPY/NN-WITH-NUMPY/NN_with_Numpy.ipynb) | - Learned under the hood operations of ANN models such as Weight initialization, activations, forward propagation, loss functions (binary cross entropy, categorical cross entropy), backward propagation, updating parameters, making predictions, testing with dummy dataset and MNIST data. |

<!-- ## MLOps

In addition to individual projects, I have experience with MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) practices and tools:

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Describe your experience with CI/CD pipelines for ML projects.
- **Containerization**: Mention your use of Docker or other containerization technologies.
- **Model Versioning**: Explain how you manage model versions and deployments.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Share your approach to monitoring and logging in production ML systems.
- **Automated Testing**: Discuss your strategies for testing ML models and pipelines.
- **Deployment**: Explain how you deploy models into production environments. -->

## About Me

My name is Sathees Paskaran, a recent graduate in IT Data Science. I have a strong passion for innovation and applying cutting-edge technologies for good. I have worked on more than 8 campus project as a team lead, and as a Software Engineering (BI, Data Engineering) intern at iTelaSoft Pvt. Ltd. I have conducted a successfull research project called CarboMeter (own idea, and leadership) which I have won till Imagine Cup 2023 world finalist. But now I focus on building a career on AI and applying it to real-world problems. For this I have completed many MOOC courses (listed on my LinekdIn profile). I am now learning PyTorch, Tensorflow, Scikit-Learn and MLOps. I am building this repo to showcase my portfolio projects to recruiters and connections.
